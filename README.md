# DocsWorker

##This application creates a Google spreadsheet named "List of files" on your Google Drive and writes the list of files that you own.
##The sync occurs every 15 minutes. 
##Deleted files first go to the bin and will still be added to the file list so don't forget about that.
##To test the app, you need to write to me (vishnevsky.dmtr@gmail.com) and I will add your email to the list of testers.
